Creating a website on GitHub serves multiple purposes:
1. Showcasing Projects: It provides a platform to display the projects I’ve worked on, demonstrating my skills and knowledge to potential employers or collaborators.
2. Documenting My Journey: A website is a great way to document my learning experiences, insights, and the challenges I’ve faced. It allows me to reflect on my progress over time.
3. Building a Portfolio: Having a personal website is essential in the tech industry. It helps establish an online presence, which can be beneficial for networking and career opportunities.
4. Learning Git: Creating the website was a practical way to become familiar with Git, tools I would need for collaborative work in the future.

Getting Started: Setting Up GitHub Pages
The first step in creating my website was to set up GitHub Pages. Here's how I did it:

Creating a Repository: I started by creating a new repository on GitHub. 

Enabling GitHub Pages: Once the repository was created, I navigated to the repository settings and enabled GitHub Pages by selecting the main branch as the source. I chose the main branch since it would automatically serve the index.html file.

Choosing a Theme: To make my website visually appealing, I selected a simple theme from the GitHub Pages options. The Minimal Mistakes theme stood out to me for its clean design and flexibility.

Creating Content: Documenting My Journey
With my website set up, it was time to start creating content. Here’s what I focused on:

About Me Section: I wrote a brief introduction about myself, highlighting my background, interests, and what sparked my passion for computer science.

Blog Posts: I began documenting my learning journey by writing blog posts. These posts covered topics I found particularly interesting or challenging, such as my experience with MIT 6.0001 and the insights I gained from various projects. Each post included reflections on what I learned and how I overcame obstacles.

Project Showcase: I created a dedicated section to showcase my projects. For each project, I provided a brief description, the technologies used, and a link to the project’s GitHub repository. This helped me demonstrate my coding skills and commitment to learning.

Resources and Tutorials: I included a section with links to helpful resources, tutorials, and courses that I found valuable. Sharing these resources felt rewarding, as they could assist others on similar learning paths.

Learning Git: Working with Git also allowed me to familiarize myself with version control. I learned how to create branches, commit changes, and push updates to my GitHub repository. This experience is invaluable as it prepares me for collaborative projects in the future.

Sharing My Website and Engaging with the Community
Once my website was live, I shared it with friends, family, and on social media platforms like LinkedIn. 

Looking Ahead: Continuous Improvement
Building my GitHub website was just the beginning. I plan to continuously update it with new blog posts, projects, and resources as I learn and grow. I also want to explore adding more interactive elements, such as tutorials or coding challenges, to engage my audience further.

Final Thoughts
Creating a GitHub Pages website to document my learning journey has been an enriching experience. It has allowed me to share my knowledge, connect with others, and showcase my projects—all while enhancing my skills in Git. I encourage anyone on a similar path to consider building their own website. It’s a rewarding way to reflect on your progress, share your journey, and contribute to the learning community.
