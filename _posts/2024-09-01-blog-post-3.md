Even though you don’t have Python experience, the good news is that it’s never too late to start, and you don’t have to jump into hardcore coding from day one. Here’s what I’d recommend if you’re interested in bridging the gap between theory and application without getting overwhelmed by coding:

Start with High-Level Machine Learning Tools:
AutoML Tools: If you're not ready to dive into coding, you could start experimenting with automated machine learning platforms like Google's AutoML or H2O.ai. These platforms let you upload data and train models without having to code everything yourself. They’ll still give you a taste of how different algorithms perform on real data, without the steep learning curve of programming.

Take an Introductory Python Course:
I highly recommend starting with a basic Python for Data Science course. It doesn’t have to be super complex, but it will help you get familiar with tools like NumPy, Pandas, and basic matplotlib for plotting. These are the building blocks for machine learning in Python, and they’ll make the transition from theory to practice much easier. Kaggle offers beginner-friendly Python tutorials with immediate feedback, which could be a great way to ease into it.
Use Machine Learning Libraries:

Once you're comfortable with basic Python, try out libraries like scikit-learn, which abstracts away a lot of the heavy coding and lets you implement machine learning algorithms with just a few lines of code. For example, you can train a logistic regression model in just a few steps, and seeing how your theoretical knowledge plays out in a real dataset can be super rewarding. You don’t need to start with deep neural networks—focus on simple models and datasets.

Use Jupyter Notebooks:
When you do start coding, Jupyter Notebooks make it easier to experiment without having to worry too much about complex programming. You can write and test small snippets of code, see outputs immediately, and even include theoretical explanations alongside your code cells. It’s a great bridge between theory and practice because it feels less like hardcore programming and more like an interactive notebook.

Interactive ML Platforms:
Platforms like Google Colab allow you to experiment with machine learning in an environment where a lot of the setup is already done for you. You can run code snippets, tweak models, and visualize results easily—all in your browser, without needing to set up anything on your local machine.

Focus on Applied ML Tutorials:
There are plenty of tutorials online that walk through machine learning concepts from both a theoretical and coding perspective. Andrew Ng’s Coursera course, for example, is great for theory, but also introduces some coding components later on. If you feel confident in your theory, these tutorials will guide you through how to apply the concepts without overwhelming you with technical jargon.
