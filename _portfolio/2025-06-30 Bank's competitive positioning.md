When similar services or products are being offered then competing on price per performance unit could be beneficial. 
One way to improve performance is to reduce the time that is needed to perform certain tasks so that the product or service could be delivered quicker.

One of the ways to make operations more efficient is to give the customer ability to handle the most important tasks by themselves. 
User-friendly self-service portal for retailers could eliminate the # of requests about transaction data, reporting, fees and configuration changes.

**Noncustomer utility mapping**

By locating your proposed offering on the thirty-six spaces of the buyer utility map, you can clearly see how, and wheather, the new idea not only creates a different utility proposition from existing offerings but also removes the biggest blocks to utility that stand in the way of converting noncustomers into customers

**Lack of excludability reinforces the risk of free riding**

Knowing from the start what price will quickly capture the mass of target buyers eliminates novelty-seeking, price-insensitive customers and skips raising and dropping the price from the beginning. Strategic price you set for your offering must not only attract buers in large numbers but also help you to retain them.

**Circumstances in Segmenting Markets**

In a world of one-size-fits-all products do no jobs satisfactorily, therefore product growth could come from nonconsumers by taking share from products in other categories.
