As a small retail business owner, I want to have a system where I can set up my devices and products so I can make sales, do inventory, make purchase orders, and manage stock receiving all in one place.

AS an owner of a listing I want to sell it in the e platform by making picture, adding video, or audio record by the phone and publish it so that all needed info: brand name, description, price could be identified from the provided info. <br/><br/>
