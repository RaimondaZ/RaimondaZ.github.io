The journey began by fostering an open mindset to experiment with AI and implementing at least one AI-aided lesson or project. Collaboration with the administration and fellow teachers ensured alignment on the support needed during the session.

Using AI apps, the lesson plan was crafted with precision, integrating age-appropriate teaching practices and accommodations for children with specific needs. AI verified teaching facts, provided reasoning, and suggested reliable data sources. The finalized plan included all necessary supporting materials and tools.

Key Benefits of AI in Teaching:

Enhanced Lesson Planning: AI tools streamline the creation of detailed, well-structured lesson plans tailored to specific age groups and learning needs.
Fact Verification: Ensures accuracy by double-checking information and sourcing reliable data.

Personalized Learning: Prompts best practices for diverse student needs, including children with learning differences.

Efficiency: Saves time on preparation, enabling teachers to focus more on the delivery of the lesson.

Feedback Integration: Supports continuous improvement by integrating insights from students and teachers for future sessions.
After the lesson, feedback was collected from children and teachers to refine the plan for future implementation. 

This project highlights AI's potential to enhance the educational experience, encouraging creativity, efficiency, and collaboration in the classroom.
